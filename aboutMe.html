        <p class="text-light fw-bold text-center" style="font-size: 24px;"> Hardworking and enthusiastic College Student working towards a B.S. in Computer & 
            Information Science at Berea College. I am experienced with various Programming Languages, development tools, 
            and procedures. Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate 
            as part of a productive team. Originally a Business major, I quickly switched to Computer Science 
            after enjoying an introduction to app development class. I got the opportunity to Join the Student 
            Software Development Team at Berea College, where my love for CS grew. I have since been enjoying web 
            development and open-source projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports of all kinds, 
            coding, reading, and writing. During a quarantined 2020, I challenged myself to read more which led me 
            to take various English courses and pursuing my minor in English. Feel free to use either of the links 
            on the home page to visit my LinkedIn and Github.</p>
