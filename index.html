          <p class="paragraph text-center text-dark">Hardworking and enthusiastic College Student working towards a B.S. in Computer & 
            Information Science at Berea College. I am experienced with various Programming Languages, development tools, 
            and procedures. Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate 
            as part of a productive team. Originally a Business major, I quickly switched to Computer Science 
            after enjoying an introduction to app development class. I got the opportunity to Join the Student 
            Software Development Team at Berea College, where my love for CS grew. I have since been enjoying web 
            development and open-source projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports of all kinds, 
            coding, reading, and writing. During a quarantined 2020, I challenged myself to read more which led me 
            to take various English courses and pursue a minor in English. Feel free to use either of the links 
            at the bottom of the home page to visit my LinkedIn and Github.</p>
